# 🎵 Neural Critic: Album Evaluator 🎵

**Neural Critic** is an open-source Streamlit app that evaluates music albums through deep audio analysis and professional-grade scoring. Trained on Metacritic scores from professional music reviewers, the app simulates the critical insight of a seasoned reviewer to give albums an authentic, critic-style rating.

Leveraging LAION's CLAP (Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining) model for extracting rich audio embeddings and a fine-tuned CatBoost regression model, Neural Critic offers an intuitive and scalable platform for music evaluation.

## 🧐 Model Training

Under `src/`, you'll find:

* `embeddings/` for generating CLAP-based audio embeddings
* `regression/` for fitting and tuning the CatBoost regression model
* `utils/` for helper functions including model saving

All training and inference logic is structured under `src/` for modularity and clarity.
